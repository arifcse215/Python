FrozenSets

The frozen sets are the immutable form of the normal sets, i.e., 
the items of the frozen set cannot be changed and therefore 
it can be used as a key in the dictionary.

The elements of the frozen set cannot be changed after the creation.
We cannot change or append the content of the frozen sets by using the methods like add() or remove().

The frozenset() method is used to create the frozenset object.
The iterable sequence is passed into this method which is 
converted into the frozen set as a return type of the method.
