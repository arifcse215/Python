Dictionary

Python Dictionary is used to store the data in a key-value pair format.
The dictionary is the data type in Python, which can simulate the real-life
data arrangement where some specific value exists for some particular key.
It is the mutable data-structure. The dictionary is defined into element Keys and values.

    Keys must be a single element
    Value can be any type such as list, tuple, integer, etc.

In other words, we can say that a dictionary is 
the collection of key-value pairs where the value can be any Python object.
In contrast, the keys are the immutable Python object, i.e., Numbers, string, or tuple.

Creating the dictionary

The dictionary can be created by using multiple key-value
pairs enclosed with the curly brackets {},
and each key is separated from its value by the colon (:).
